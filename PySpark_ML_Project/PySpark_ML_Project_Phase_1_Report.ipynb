    "## Project Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "Airline On-Time Performance, defined as a flight arriving within 15 minutes of expected arrival time, is a critical key performance indicator airlines and regulators track across the flight industry. The TranStats flight data from the US Department of Transportation, USDOT,  indicates 18% of flights were delayed by more than 15 minutes between 2015-2021, illustrating room for improvement across the industry. Each minute a flight is delayed can lead to escalating operational costs, especially with the USDOTâ€™s new ruling requiring airline companies to provide automatic refunds for any domestic flights delayed three hours or more.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of our classification model is to predict if a flight will be delayed two hours prior to the flight's expected departure time. Flight data from TranStats will be used to identify effects of flight delays across the network. Additionally, we will supplement flight information with weather data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to further determine temporal trends and impacts to delays. Our machine learning pipeline includes checkpoints for feature extraction and feature engineering to prevent data leakage, create temporal and graph features, and appropriately balancing and splitting our feature set prior to model training. We will use logistic regression and random forests as our baseline due to their intepretability before experimenting with other algorithms. Precision, recall, and f1 score will be used to evaluate and select our optimal model. Once our optimal is identified, we look to further enhance our predictions with the estimated time of delay and type of delay to allow airline companies to prioritize and mitigate potential delays and costs.\n"

    "The data for the project will be sourced from three different datasets.\n",
    "  - The first is flight information from the US Department of Transportation (DOT). This contains 109 features and ~31.7 million rows. It contains information related to the flights such as departure and arrival destinations, fligth durations (taxi and flight times), carrier information, distance traveled, and whether the flight was delayed or diverted. This data will be limited to US states and territories for depature and arrival locations. The full dataset contains information from 2015 to 2021.\n",
    "  - The second dataset contains weather information from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. This contains 177 features and ~630.9 million rows. It contains various weather information such as temperature, humidity, precipitation, visiblity, sunrise time, and sunset time. The location information and time information can be used to join with the flight dataset to gain information on potential weather features impacting flight delays. The full dataset contains information from 2015 to 2021.\n",
    "  - The final dataset contains airport information from the US DOT. This contains 10 features and ~18K rows. It contains location information for airports which can be used to merge the weather and flight datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data has been split into various time intervals to perform initial model development. This will allow for testing and working on scalability of the process. For the flight and weather data there are splits for Q1 2015 (3 months of data), Q1 and Q2 2015 (6 months of data), 2019 (1 year of data), and the full datasets from 2015-2021.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the scope of the project, predicting a 15 minute delay two hours before a flight. Data will need to be filtered and masked while training the model to avoid data leak. Information that would not be available two hours before a flight, such as actual departure time of a flight or a delay reason will be masked. However, the data source contains complete flight information for the day and the flight numbers to track the planes movement. A previous flights information for a plane will be utilized, such as actual departure time or delay information will be utilized (if it is available prior to two hours of the current flight)."

    "## Machine Learning Algorithms and Metrics\n",
    "For this project, we are focusing on predicting **departure delays** where a delay is defined as being 15 minutes or greater past the planned departure time. The prediction will be made at least **two hours before departure** to allow sufficient time for airlines and airports to notify passengers and adjust operations. Our primary stakeholders include airlines, airports, and passengers. This is framed as a **classification problem**, where the target variable is whether a flight will be delayed or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our baseline and model iterations to predict departure delays will focus on the following algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Logistic Regression**:\n",
    "   - **Implementation**: Using `PySpark`'s `LogisticRegression` class.\n",
    "   - **Loss Function**: Binary Cross-Entropy Loss:\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     L = -\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} [y_i \\log(\\hat{y}_i) + (1 - y_i) \\log(1 - \\hat{y}_i)]\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "   - **Reasoning**: A simple baseline to understand feature importance and build interpretability.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Random Forest Classifier**:\n",
    "   - **Implementation**: Using `PySpark`'s `RandomForestClassifier`.\n",
    "   - **Feature Importance**: Helps identify critical factors contributing to delays.\n",
    "   - **Advantage**: Good for capturing non-linear relationships and robust to overfitting with proper tuning while providing high interpretability.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Gradient Boosted Trees**:\n",
    "   - **Implementation**: Using `PySpark`'s `SparkXGBRegressor`\n",
    "   - **Loss Function**: Logistic loss for binary classification.\n",
    "   - **Advantage**: Effective for handling imbalanced data and complex relationships.\n",
    "   - **Reasoning**: Provides high predictive power while maintaining efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "The method that can be used for cross-validating the time-series model is rolling cross-validation. This approach ensures that the temporal structure of the data is preserved, which is essential for time-series problems where past information should not have access to future data. This rolling cross-validation approach is particularly useful for ensuring that the model's predictions remain robust over time and that it adapts to changes or trends in the data. Additionally, it helps prevent data leakage by maintaining the correct sequence of training and validation periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate the performance of our models, we will use a combination of the following metrics: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Precision**:\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\text{Precision} = \\frac{\\text{True Positives}}{\\text{True Positives} + \\text{False Positives}}\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   Indicates how many of our predicted delays are actual delays to avoid false alerts to airline companies. Higher precision may lead to missed predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Recall**:\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\text{Recall} = \\frac{\\text{True Positives}}{\\text{True Positives} + \\text{False Negatives}}\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   Essential for identifying the most delays to minimize unexpected delays. Higher recall may lead to incorrectly identifying flight delays.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **F1-Score**:\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\text{F1-Score} = 2 \\times \\frac{\\text{Precision} \\times \\text{Recall}}{\\text{Precision} + \\text{Recall}}\n",

    "To enable airline companies to mitigate costs from flight delays, we will create a classification model to predict if a flight will be delayed two hours prior to it's expected departure. Our initial EDA determined key data elements, methods to prevent data leakage, feature engineering requirements, and options for data splitting for our data pipeline. In the next phase, we will use the groundwork EDA in this phase to complete our data pipeline and assess our model baselines via random forest and logistic regression algorithms before further refinement to select the optimal model and further experimentation for additional time of delay and type of delay predictions."
