Explanatory Model Project: Building a Regression Model within a Causal Framework

This project utilized product data from the Sephora website. I led a team of three in evaluating statistical assumptions behind various linear regression models. We identified a statistically significant positive effect of product variations on product popularity, potentially driving business strategies for increased product likeability. The project was completed using the R programming language.
